		<h1>A Statement.</h1>
		<p>My name is Matthew Long, and I am running for the Cromwell Board of Assessment Appeals.</p>

		<h1>My Record</h1>
		<center><i>Three Key Values</i></center>
		<h2>Fairness</h2>
		<p>Every decision I made in my time on the board has come from a place of wanting to ensure everyone is treated fairly. I have asked thousands of questions, reviewed hundreds of pages of evidence, and spent many hours carefully deliberating all decisions.</p>
		<h2>Openess</h2>
		<p>On the board, I requested that all meeting minutes be made publicly available online. Tax payers are no longer kept in the dark about board decisions and can review every vote and important discussion we hold.</p>
		<h2>Accessibility</h2>
		<p>I have fought to ensure that the process is as painless as possible. In my time on the board, we implemented the two-year rule for vehicle appeals. Taxpayers who are granted a lower car assessment will now never have to worry about their valuation going up the next year.</p>
